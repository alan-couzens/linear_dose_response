# linear_dose_response
linear dose response model that takes time in zone (min) and builds model to predict FTP

To create a linear model from your own data, either manually update the data in the file or import a Training Peaks 'workouts.csv' into the same directory.

Note: Training Peaks summary csv will be parsed to create the input data but you still need to manually adjust the FTP values in the file.
